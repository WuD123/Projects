# Projects
1) Diploma Thesis (Timetracking)
    -> iOS-, Android- and Web-App which allows employees of Tailored Apps to easily track their work time
       using Geofencing, Bluetooth and NFC. I developed the iOS-App and was heavily involved in designing
       database structure.
2) Tourplanner
    -> WPF-App which allows people to plan and store a route to drive, bike or walk. The most optimal route
       and visual presentation of the route was created using a freely accessible API.
3) Hacking Lab
    -> Implement vulnerabilities (broken authentication / broken access control) and show how to exploit these.
    -> Give recommendations and tips for developers to prevent accidentally coding said vulnerabilities.
       (Documentation TBD)
